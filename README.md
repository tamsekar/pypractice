What to learn next?

There are various intermediate Python programming topics that are useful to know. These are not yet covered on Python Principles, since we currently focus on beginner topics.

If you want to move on to the intermediate level of programming, you'll benefit from learning about each of these:

    exceptions
    sets
    defining custom classes
    reading from and writing to files
    reading user input from the terminal
    modules and imports
    generating random numbers
    reading documentation


Projects

A great way to improve your programming skills is to complete a coding project you are genuinely interested in.

Coming up with a project can be difficult, however. A good basis might be to think of things you do on a computer that are repetitive and boring, and which you'd like to automate.

We have collected a long list of project ideas in a [blog post](https://pythonprinciples.com/blog/programming-project-ideas/) that you can find inspiration from.

Advanced topics

Here are some more advanced topics and skills that you can work on if you're out of other ideas:

    recursion
    list comprehensions
    effective debugging
    writing clean code
    writing unit tests
    algorithms and data structures
